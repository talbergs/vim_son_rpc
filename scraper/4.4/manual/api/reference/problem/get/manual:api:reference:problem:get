===== problem.get =====

==== Description ====

''integer/array problem.get(object **parameters**)''

The method allows to retrieve problems according to the given parameters.

This method is for retrieving unresolved problems. It is also possible, if specified, to additionally retrieve recently resolved problems. The period that determines how old is "recently" is defined in //Administration// -> //[[:manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/administration/general#trigger_displaying_options|General]]//. Problems that were resolved prior to that period are not kept in the problem table. To retrieve problems that were resolved further back in the past, use the [[:manual/api/reference/event/get|event.get]] method.

<note important>This method may return problems of a deleted entity if these problems have not been removed by the housekeeper yet.</note>
==== Parameters ====

The method supports the following parameters.

^ Parameter ^ Type ^ Description ^

^ |||
| source | integer | Return only problems with the given type. \\ \\ Refer to the  [[object#problem|problem event object page]] for a list of supported event types. \\ \\ Default: 0 - problem created by a trigger. |
| object | integer | Return only problems created by objects of the given type. \\ \\ Refer to the  [[object#problem|problem event object page]] for a list of supported object types. \\ \\ Default: 0 - trigger. |
| acknowledged | boolean | ''true'' - return acknowledged problems only; \\ ''false'' - unacknowledged only. |
| suppressed | boolean | ''true'' - return only suppressed problems; \\ ''false'' - return problems in the normal state. |
| severities | integer/array | Return only problems with given event severities. Applies only if object is trigger. |
| evaltype   | integer          | Rules for tag searching. \\ \\ Possible values: \\ 0 - (default) And/Or; \\ 2 - Or.        |
| tags       | array of objects | Return only problems with given tags. Exact match by tag and case-insensitive search by value and operator. \\ Format: ''<nowiki>[{"tag": "<tag>", "value": "<value>", "operator": "<operator>"}, ...]</nowiki>''.\\ An empty array returns all problems. \\ \\ Possible operator types: \\ 0 - (default) Like; \\ 1 - Equal. |
| recent | boolean | ''true'' - return PROBLEM and recently RESOLVED problems (depends on Display OK triggers for N seconds) \\ Default: ''false'' - UNRESOLVED problems only |
| eventid_from | string | Return only problems with IDs greater or equal to the given ID. |
| eventid_till | string | Return only problems with IDs less or equal to the given ID. |
| time_from | timestamp | Return only problems that have been created after or at the given time. |
| time_till | timestamp | Return only problems that have been created before or at the given time. |
^ |||
| selectAcknowledges | query | Return an ''acknowledges'' property with the problem updates. Problem updates are sorted in reverse chronological order. \\ \\ The problem update object has the following properties: \\ ''acknowledgeid'' - ''(string)'' update's ID; \\ ''userid'' - ''(string)'' ID of the user that updated the event; \\ ''eventid'' - ''(string)'' ID of the updated event; \\ ''clock'' - ''(timestamp)'' time when the event was updated; \\ ''message'' - ''(string)'' text of the message; \\ ''action'' - ''(integer)'' update action that was performed see [[manual:api:reference:event:acknowledge|event.acknowledge]]; \\ ''old_severity'' - ''(integer)'' event severity before this update action; \\ ''new_severity'' - ''(integer)'' event severity after this update action; \\  \\ Supports ''count''. |
| selectTags | query | Return a ''[[:manual/api/reference/trigger/object#trigger_tag|tags]]'' property with the problem tags. Output format: ''<nowiki>[{"tag": "<tag>", "value": "<value>"}, ...]</nowiki>''. |
| selectSuppressionData | query | Return a ''suppression_data'' property with the list of maintenances: \\ ''maintenanceid'' - ''(string)'' ID of the maintenance; \\ ''suppress_until'' - ''(integer)'' time until the problem is suppressed. |
^ |||
| sortfield | string/array | Sort the result by the given properties. \\ \\ Possible values are: ''eventid''. |
| countOutput |boolean|These parameters being common for all ''get'' methods are described in detail in the [[manual:api:reference_commentary#common_get_method_parameters|reference commentary]] page.  |
